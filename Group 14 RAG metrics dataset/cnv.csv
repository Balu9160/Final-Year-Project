Question,Answer
"What is Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)?","Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels form beneath the retina, potentially leading to severe vision impairment."
"What causes CNV?","CNV is often caused by conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), high myopia, inflammation, or eye trauma."
"How does CNV affect my vision?","CNV can lead to fluid leakage or bleeding into the retina, causing macular degeneration and vision loss."
"What are the main types of CNV?","The main types are Classic CNV, Occult CNV, Type 1 (sub-retinal pigment epithelium), and Type 2 (sub-retinal)."
"What is the difference between Classic and Occult CNV?","Classic CNV appears well-defined and is more aggressive, while Occult CNV is less defined and progresses more slowly."
"What is Anti-VEGF treatment?","Anti-VEGF injections reduce abnormal blood vessel growth, helping to control CNV progression."
"Are Anti-VEGF injections painful?","Patients may experience mild discomfort, but the procedure is typically quick and done under local anesthesia."
"How often will I need Anti-VEGF injections?","Usually every 4-8 weeks, depending on the condition's severity and response to treatment."
"What risks are associated with Anti-VEGF injections?","Possible side effects include eye redness, discomfort, and, rarely, infection or increased eye pressure."
"What is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)?","PDT uses a photosensitizing drug and laser to target abnormal blood vessels, helping reduce fluid leakage."
"Is laser treatment an option for CNV?","Yes, laser photocoagulation is sometimes used, though it's typically reserved for specific cases due to risks."
"Can surgery treat CNV?","Surgery is rarely the first option and is generally only considered for severe cases with extensive leakage or retinal detachment."
"How is CNV diagnosed?","CNV is diagnosed through a comprehensive eye exam, OCT imaging, and sometimes angiography tests like fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography."
"What are the signs of CNV?","Signs include blurry or distorted vision, seeing dark spots, and sometimes sudden vision loss."
"Am I at risk for CNV if I have high myopia?","Yes, high myopia increases the risk of CNV due to the elongated eye shape, which can strain the retina."
"Does my family history affect my CNV risk?","Yes, a family history of macular conditions like AMD can increase the risk of developing CNV."
"Can smoking increase my risk of CNV?","Yes, smoking accelerates retinal aging and increases the risk of AMD-related CNV."
"How can I monitor my symptoms at home?","An Amsler grid can help detect any visual distortions, allowing you to monitor changes in your vision."
"What lifestyle changes can help manage CNV?","Eating an antioxidant-rich diet, controlling blood pressure, quitting smoking, and wearing UV protection can help."
"Should I avoid any specific foods?","It's recommended to limit processed foods and sugars as they can impact blood glucose control and eye health."
"Can CNV be cured?","While CNV can’t be cured, treatments like Anti-VEGF injections and PDT can help manage and slow its progression."
"What are the dietary recommendations for CNV?","A diet high in leafy greens, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin C-rich foods is beneficial for eye health."
"How often should I have follow-up exams?","Typically every 4-6 weeks during treatment, depending on your doctor’s recommendation and your condition's progression."
"What are low vision aids?","Low vision aids include tools like magnifiers and special lighting that help manage vision impairment in daily tasks."
"How can support groups help if I have CNV?","Support groups offer mental support, resources, and coping strategies for managing potential vision loss."
